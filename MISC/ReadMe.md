# MISC

## Introduction

The proposed maceral analysis method, MISC, based on image segmentation and classification 
makes it possible to identify the maceral composition automatically and intelligently.
We integrated 2-level K-means segmentation algorithm and various classification algorithms 
described in the following paper:
"Intelligent identification of maceral components of coal based on image segmentation and classification" submitted to Applied Sciences.

**Note**: this package requires installing Matlab **R2016b** or latter.

## Installation 

1. The software of MISC was implemented in Matlab, and could be installed on
Windows systems. MISC distributions for Windows can be found at 
https://github.com/GuyooGu/MISC-Master/tree/master/MISC . We recommend that users can download the latest release. 

2. After downloading, please double-click on the file 'MISC.exe' to run the executable file：MISC.exe

3. Select an image（such as test_image_1.bmp） for analysis.

4. Select the segmentation method and the calssification methods. 
The segmentation results are presented as 4 subfigures, corresponding to the binders and 3 maceral groups. The classification result for each object detected by image segmentation is shown with different colors for visualization.
